# channelStreamImplementation

Channels are hot in nature. Producers produce data doesn't matter if any consumer is consuming it or not.
Example- 
1) Radio Station streams data continously, doesn't matter if any consumer is consuming it or not.
2) Movie at 4Pm in Theater.
Disadvatange- 1) Already produced data at a particular pt. of time cannnot be recovered. We will only get data when we join.
 2) Resource wastage because when consumer isn't consuming data, but still producers are producing.
 3) Manual close
